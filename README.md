# CRIME AGAINST WOMEN FROM 2001-2014

Crimes against women have been a growing concern, with several forms of violence and exploitation becoming increasingly prevalent over the years. 
Common types of crime include rape, kidnapping and abduction, dowry deaths, assault on women with intent to outrage modesty, insult to modesty, cruelty by husbands or relatives, and importation of girls. 
From 2001 to 2014, the data shows a significant upward trend in these crimes, particularly in cruelty by husbands, assault on women, and kidnapping. For instance, cruelty by husbands nearly doubled during 
this period, highlighting a disturbing societal issue. 

Performed data exploration and visualization using Python and related libraries to create key performance indicators (KPIs), such as 
1. identifying the crime categories with the highest growth rates
2. analyzing yearly trends
3. pinpointing the categories with the highest overall crime numbers

These KPIs help shed light on how certain crimes, like cruelty and kidnapping, surged, requiring immediate policy intervention.
